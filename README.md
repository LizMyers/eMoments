### eMoments
DISCLAIMER: if you're not an FTE at G. - this project will not work. It requires a BlueTooth connection to an authenticated machine.

### Description
eMoments allows employees to voice their opinion about common topics. For example, after an #allhands meeting, employees may want to voice an opinion about what was just discussed. They can write a few words of text (think shorter Tweets) and select one of 5 colors to express their mood. There's an internal web page which displays each eMoment as a block of color with the text inside and any hashtags assigned. In sum, eMoments gives management greater visibility into the reaction to their initiatives - whilst protecting employees anonymity and right to free speech.

### Why This Project
In order to accelerate awareness and adoption the eMoments team is currently running an internal contest. They are looking for the most creative/clever implementations on IoT devices. The projects below are Liz's entries in the competition.
